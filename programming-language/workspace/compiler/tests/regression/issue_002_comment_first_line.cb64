# Regression Test: Issue #002 - Comment as first line in function body
#
# Bug: Parser fails with "Expected indented block, found NEWLINE"
#      when a comment is the first line after function definition
# Status: KNOWN BUG (not fixed)
# Workaround: Put actual code before comments, or use inline comments
#
# This demonstrates the workaround. The bug occurs with:
#
# def main():
#     # This comment causes the bug
#     x: byte = 1
#
# Workaround is to put code first:

def main():
    x: byte = 1  # Comment after code works fine
    y: byte = 2
    println(x + y)
