# Regression Test: Issue #003 - Signed type comparison limitations
#
# Bug: Cannot compare sbyte with byte or use sbyte in some contexts
# Status: KNOWN LIMITATION
# Error: "Cannot compare sbyte and byte"
#
# This test uses only unsigned types as workaround.

def main():
    x: byte = 10  # Using byte instead of sbyte
    y: byte = 20

    if x < y:
        println("X < Y")

    # Workaround for negative values:
    # Use byte with values > 127 representing negative
    # (two's complement interpretation)
    neg: byte = 246  # Represents -10 in two's complement
    println(neg)
